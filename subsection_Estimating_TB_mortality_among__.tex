\subsection{Estimating TB mortality among HIV-negative people from estimates of case-fatality rates and TB incidence
}

In 94 countries lacking VR data of the necessary coverage and quality, TB mortality was estimated as the product of TB incidence (see section 4) and the CFR after disaggregation by case type as shown in Table A1.1, following a literature review of CFRs by the TB Modelling and Analysis Consortium (TB-MAC):

$M = (I-N)F_u + NF_n$ , where $M$ denotes mortality, $I$ incidence. $F_u$ and $F_n$ denote CFRs untreated and treated, respectively. $N$ denotes the number of notified TB cases. In countries where the number of treated patients that are not notified (under-reporting) is known from an inventory study, $N$ is adjusted upwards to account for under-reporting. 

\begin{table} 
    \begin{tabular}{ c c c }
         & CFR & Sources \\ 
        Not on TB treatment $F_u$ & 0.43 (0.28- 0.53) &  \cite{12742798} \cite{21483732} \\ 
        On TB treatment $F_n$ & 0.03 (0.00-0.07) &  \cite{21738585} \\ 
    \end{tabular} 
\end{table}

This approach tends to overestimate TB mortality in countries with no VR or mortality survey data and the level of under-reporting of treated TB cases is unknown and large relative to the number of reported cases.
