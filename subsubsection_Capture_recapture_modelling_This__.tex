\subsubsection {Capture-recapture modelling.} This method is used for 5 countries: Egypt\cite{20487611}, Iraq\cite{23485379}, the Netherlands\cite{17156496}, the United Kingdom\cite{Anderson2010} and Yemen\cite{23485378}. They accounted for 0.5\% of the estimated global number of incident cases in 2014. Capture-recapture modelling was considered in studies with at least 3 lists and estimation of list dependencies\cite{WHO2012}. The estimate of the surveillance gap in the UK and the Netherlands was assumed time invariant. In Yemen, trends in incidence were derived from results of two consecutive tuberculin surveys\cite{19723398}. In Egypt and Iraq, trends were derived using methods described in section 4.1.1.
