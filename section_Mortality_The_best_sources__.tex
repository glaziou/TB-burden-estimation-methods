\section{Mortality}  

The best sources of data about deaths from TB (excluding TB deaths among HIV-positive people) are VR systems in which causes of death are coded according to ICD-10 (although the older ICD-9 and ICD-8 classification are still in use in several countries). Deaths from TB in HIV-positive people are coded under HIV-associated codes.  Two methods were used to estimate TB mortality among HIV-negative people:   

\begin{itemize}
    \item direct measurements of mortality from VR systems or mortality surveys (129 countries, in green in Figure \ref{fig:vr});
    \item indirect estimates derived from multiplying estimates of TB incidence by estimates of the CFR (88 countries).
    \end{itemize}  
    
Each method is described in more detail below.
