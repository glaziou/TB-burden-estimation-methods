\textbf{TB incidence disaggregated by sex}. Using the sex disaggregated reporting of TB case notification data we estimated the ratio of the number of TB cases notified in men compared with women. It was assumed this is the same as the ratio $r_1$ for incident cases. Evidence from national prevalence surveys of bacteriologically-positive TB consistently show bigger recording and detection gaps between prevalence and case notifications in men than women. This suggests that the assumption of no sex differential in the detection of incident cases may not be correct. With currently available data, it is not possible to estimate male and female case detection ratios for all countries. $I_m$ may be underestimated relative to $I_a$.    

Overall incidence in adults 15 years or over ($I_a$) can be disaggregated into estimates among men ($I_m$) and women ($I_w$) as shown

\begin{align}
r_1 &= \frac{I_m}{I_w} \\
I_a &= I_m + I_w
\end{align}

Country level estimates are generated and then aggregated at the regional and global levels.
