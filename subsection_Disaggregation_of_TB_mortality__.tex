\subsection{Disaggregation of TB mortality by age and sex}

\subsubsectiom{TB deaths among HIV-negative people}

From the age-specific adjusted (for coverage and ill-defined causes) number of deaths from VR, we first estimated the ratio $r_2$ of rates in children ($M_{0-14}$) compared to adults ($M_{15+}$) (\ref{eqn:r2}. The overall mortality rate for all ages ($M$) can be expressed as a weighted average of mortality in children and adults, where  is the proportion of children among the general population \ref{eqn:M}.

\begin{equation}
\begin{align}
r_2 &= \frac{M_{0-14}}{M_{15+}} \label{eqn:r2} \\
M &= c M_{0-14} + (1 - c) M_{15+} \label{eqn:M}
\end{align}
\end{equation}

$M_{0-14}$ for countries with VR data is directly measured. For countries without VR data an imputation step is necessary where the ratio $r$ is predicted from a regression model with risk factors known to be associated with TB.
