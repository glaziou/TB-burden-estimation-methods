\subsection{Disaggregation of TB mortality by age and sex}

\subsubsection{TB deaths among HIV-negative people}

From the age-specific adjusted (for coverage and ill-defined causes) number of deaths from VR, we first estimated the ratio $r_2$ of rates in children ($M_{0-14}$) compared to adults ($M_{15+}$) (\ref{eqn:r2}). The overall mortality rate for all ages ($M$) can be expressed as a weighted average of mortality in children and adults, where $c$ is the proportion of children among the general population (\ref{eqn:M}).

\begin{equation}
\begin{align}
r_2 &= \frac{M_{0-14}}{M_{15+}} \label{eqn:r2} \\
M &= c M_{0-14} + (1 - c) M_{15+} \label{eqn:M}
\end{align}
\end{equation}

In countries with VR or mortality survey data, $M_{0-14}$ is directly measured. For countries without VR data, an imputation step is necessary where the ratio $r_2$ is predicted from a regression model with risk factors known to be associated with TB. For the sex disaggregation of TB mortality among adults ($M_{15+}$), we use sex-specific adjusted (for coverage and ill-defined causes) number of deaths from VR to estimate mortality rates in men $M_m$  and women $M_w$ (\ref{eqn:mm}). The ratio of these rates $r_3$ (\ref{eqn:r3}) is either directly measured in countries with VR data or imputed in countries without.

\begin{equation}
\begin{align}
M_{15+} &= M_w + M_m \label{eqn:mm} \\
r_3 &= \frac{M_m}{M_w} \label{eqn:r3}
\end{align}
\end{equation}


\subsubsection{TB deaths among HIV-positive people}

TB deaths among HIV-positive people were disaggregated by age and sex using the assumption that the child to adult and men to women ratios are the same as the sex ratios of AIDS deaths estimated by UNAIDS, which are estimated for all countries in the world. Once ratios are calculated, equations (\ref{eqn:r2})-(\ref{eqn:r3}) can be used to complete disaggregation of TB deaths among HIV-positive people in children, men and women.
