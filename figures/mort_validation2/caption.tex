Comparison of VR mortality (HIV-negative), horizontal axis (log scale) and mortality predicted as the product of incidence and CFR, vertical axis (log scale). Horizontal and vertical segments indicate uncertainty intervals. The dashed red line shows equality. The blue line and associated grey banner show the least-squared best fit to the data, with a slope not constrained to one.
