\label{fig:incmethods}Main method to estimate TB incidence. In the first method, case notification data are combined with expert opinion about case detection gaps (under-reporting and under-diagnosis), and trends are estimated using either mortality data, repeat surveys of the annual risk of infection or exponential interpolation using estimates of case detection gaps for three years. For all high-income countries except the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, notifications are adjusted by a standard amount or by measures of under-reporting from inventory studies, to account for case detection gaps.
