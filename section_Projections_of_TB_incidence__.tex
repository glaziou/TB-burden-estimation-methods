\section{Projections of TB incidence, prevalence and mortality rates up to 2015} 

Projections of incidence, prevalence and mortality up to 2015 enable assessment of whether global targets set for 2015 are likely to be achieved at global, regional and country levels. Projections for the year 2015 were made using exponential smoothing models fitted to data from 2007â€“2014. The projection is based on an algorithm that selects the best among models within a family of exponential smoothing models, using a penalized likelihood method as a selection criterion\cite{Hyndman2008-ax}. Tested models include trend components in the following list: no trend, additive, additive damped, multiplicative, or multiplicative damped, with no seasonal components, with additive and multiplicative error terms. Point forecasts are computing using the best model with optimized parameters and uncertainty is propagated using analytical methods described in the next section.
