\section{Projections of TB incidence, prevalence and mortality rates up to 2015} 

Projections of incidence, prevalence and mortality up to 2015 enable assessment of whether global targets set for 2015 are likely to be achieved at global, regional and country levels. Projections for the years 2013–2015 were made using exponential smoothing models fitted to data from 2006–2013.
