\subsection {Results from inventory/capture-recapture studies\cite{WHO2012}.} This method is used for 5 countries: Egypt, Iraq, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Yemen. They accounted for 0.5\% of the estimated global number of incident cases in 2014. Capture-recapture (CR) modelling was considered in studies with at least 3 lists and estimation of list dependencies. The CR-based estimate of the surveillance gap in the UK and the Netherlands was assumed time invariant. In Yemen, trends were derived from results of repeat tuberculin surveys (for details about the approach, see group 5 below).
